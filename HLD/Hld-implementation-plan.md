🎯 Next Steps
Option 1: Continue Building Incrementally
Continue adding sections one by one, similar to LLD approach.

Estimated Effort:

Remaining patterns: ~200 lines
Reliability & Performance: ~300 lines
Problem-solving framework: ~200 lines
All 30 problems (detailed): ~2000-2500 lines
Interview tips & reference: ~300 lines
Total remaining: ~3000-3500 lines
Final document: ~4000-4500 lines (similar to LLD.md)
Option 2: Focus on Most Critical Sections First
Prioritize the most interview-relevant content:

Problem-solving framework (how to approach any question)
Top 10 most common problems (detailed solutions)
Quick reference guides
Interview communication tips
Estimated Effort:

Framework: ~200 lines
Top 10 problems: ~1000 lines
Quick reference: ~150 lines
Interview tips: ~150 lines
Total: ~1500 lines (faster completion)
💡 Recommended Approach
Given the scope, I recommend Option 1 to create a comprehensive guide similar to the well-received LLD document, covering:

✅ All fundamental building blocks (DONE)
Complete all design patterns
Detailed problem-solving methodology
All 30 problems with full architectures
Interview strategies and quick references
This will create a complete, production-ready HLD guide that mirrors the quality and depth of the LLD documentation.

⏱️ Time Estimation
Completing remaining patterns: 15 minutes
Reliability & performance section: 20 minutes
Problem-solving framework: 15 minutes
All 30 problems (the biggest section): 45-60 minutes
Interview tips & references: 15 minutes
Total estimated time: ~2 hours for comprehensive completion

🚀 Ready to Continue?
The foundation is strong. The remaining work will follow the same high-quality, detailed approach used for both the LLD guide and the initial HLD sections completed so far.

Shall I proceed with completing all sections sequentially to create the comprehensive HLD fundamentals guide?
