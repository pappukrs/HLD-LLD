# 37 Niche System Design Problems

Prepare for system design interviews targeting Senior & Staff+ roles at Big Tech (with compensation crossing 75 LPA - 1Cr+)

## Compensation Context

- A Senior Engineer at Amazon in India (L6) can make 1Cr+
- A Senior Engineer at Microsoft in India (L64) can make 1Cr+
- A Senior Engineer at Google in India (L5) can make 1Cr+

Tech salaries at upper-level roles are high, but so is the standard of the interview loop.

## Overview

I compiled questions I used while preparing and put 37 of them into 6 categories for focused practice.
